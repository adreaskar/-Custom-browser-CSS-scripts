### After installing the extension, you can head over to userstyles.org and install any style:

> [Youtube Custom Accent Color](https://userstyles.org/styles/187051/youtube-custom-accent-color)

### If the userstyles.org website is not responding, you can manually import styles:

1) Click on the extension icon and then click the "Manage" button.

2) On the **Backup** section click import and select the .json file that's included in the repository.

The styles are constantly under development and new features are being added.
